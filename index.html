              <blockquote> "I earnestly hope that our sisters would no longer nurse the view that they are weak. Armed women of India will demolish a thousand hurdles, disregard a thousand dangers and join the rebellion and the armed struggle for freedom. They will prepare themselves for it. With this hope in my heart I am proceeding to-day for self-immolation" (Waddedar 1993: 267)</blockquote>
          <p> Pritilata Waddedar was an anti-colonial Indian nationalist who participated in the 1932 Chittagong Uprising. On September 23, Pritilata, along with the rest of her grop led by Surya Sen, launched an attack on the Pahartali European Institute. Adamant on not letting herself be caught and tortured by the  police, Pritilata drank cyanide and died immediately . Later it was reported that a “woman, dressed as man” was found near the Pahartali Institute, and her body had several leftist   paraphernalia. While she was branded a “Agnikanyā” (Daughter of Fire) by the people of her village, she fell through the cracks of history as people came to revere other (men) revolutionaries such as Bhagat Singh. She was labelled a “terrorist” by the colonial government and was therefore written off in national history textbooks, a legacy that has remained. Her position in history disrupts the masculinist nationalist vision of a the “chaste’ Indian woman, the colonial history of “peasant revolts” (she came from an educated background, having studied in Calcutta and taught at a school prior to joining the armed struggle against colonialism), and the nation-state’s vision of the “wifely” revolutionary woman who focused on building the nation from within their homes.. </p>

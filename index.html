        <h3>Rise to Power</h3>
        <p>
          Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military leader during the revolutionary wars who created the first French empire after crowning himself Emperor in 1804. Born in Corsica to a bourgeois family, he entered the army as an artillery officer (the only commission available to a non-noble) and quickly gained a reputation as a competent military leader. Through his successes on campaign in Italy, he gained the reputation that would enable him to seize power in the Brumaire coup of 1799.

        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>
          He is a controversial figure among historians, with some viewing his rise to power from being a commoner and his modernization of French society and law as the culmination of the revolutionary aims, and others viewing his authoritarianism and wars of aggression as the betrayal of the revolutionary ideals. He was significant in European history as his expansion as far as Moscow upset the power relations between the major European states and necessitated a new balance of power set out in the congress of Vienna. He also carried out a number of reforms to French military doctrine that defined how a successful modern military behaved, with a focus on logistics and discipline that allowed his army to be the most successful military force of its time.

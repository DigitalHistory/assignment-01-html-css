                <p class="description">
                    One of the great novelists of the late 20th
                    Century, Ursula Le Guin died on January 22, 1918,
                    approximately a year ago. Her works of speculative
                    fiction include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lathe_of_Heaven">The Lathe of Heaven</a> (strongly influenced by Taoism),
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>
                    (an &ldquo;ambiguous Utopia&rdquo; heavily influenced by anarchist political theory),
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness">the Left Hand of Darkness</a> (a milestone in feminist science fiction), the remarkable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Ways_to_Forgiveness">Four Ways to Forgiveness</a>
                    (a science-fictional exploration of slavery),
                    as well as the 6-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsea">Earthsea</a> series,
                    perhaps the most serious work of fantastical fiction in the English language.
